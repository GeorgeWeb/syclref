| [cl::sycl::half]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _api-docs/half_type.h/cl::sycl::half/index.md %}) | Definition of half type. This class is used to represent a 16 bit floating point number.for code compiled for the device this class will use the compiler builtin __fp16 and compile directly to native half instructions. For the host it only operates as a storage type: floating point numbers will be transformed into 16 bits and back but the actual computation will be performed by casting back to a 32 bit float  |
